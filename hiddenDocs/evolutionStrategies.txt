A different evolution might be based around set pairings. 
Basically, heuristics that look like this: 
If your opponent has a tile in any of the positions SET1, choose a tile from the positions SET2. 

We can write this as a simple pair of arrays, given an appropriate reader. 
A genome could then consist of a set of such pairs. 

If opponent is in spot X, take spot X+n around edge. 

take the next/previous square. take the next/previous L. 

A program that challenges you to approximate a curve. 

The body keeps the score.
