export const neuroBlurb1 = `Neuro learns by updating a neural network—-a network of activation units modeled on the biological brain—-using an algorithm called "back propagation". This is the AI behind "deep learning", in which extraordinarily deep neural networks have immeasurably many hidden neurons between input and output. To play noughts and crosses, however, only a shallow network is required... `
