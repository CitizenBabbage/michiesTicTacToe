export const neuroBlurb2 = `Neuro is trained by showing it board states and asking it to give a score to each possible move. These are then compared to the scores provided by Minimax, and the difference is called the "error". Neuro uses an algorithm called back propagation to reduce this error. Back propagation works by reducing the influence of those neurons that cause the error to be too high, and increasing the influence of those neurons pushing the scores in the right direction.`
