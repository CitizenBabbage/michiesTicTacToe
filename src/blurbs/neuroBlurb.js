export const neuroBlurb = `Neuro learns by updating a neural network--a network of activation units modeled on the biological brain--using an algorithm called back propagation. This is the kind of AI behind 'deep learning', which involves extraordinarily deep neural networks that have immeasurably many hidden neurons between input and output. For learning to play noughts and crosses, however, only a shallow network is required... `
